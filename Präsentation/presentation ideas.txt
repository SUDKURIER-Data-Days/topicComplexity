# 1) Lead Question: How complex are articles in different resorts?
- Database of articles published on suedkurier.de
- Aim: calculate complexity of articles to determine patterns within a resort, required language level

# 2) A glimpse of the dataset
    - Show pictures of cxense, point out determining factors we will use in our calculations

# 3) Calculation
- Idea:
    - How to calculate complexity?
    - Solution: complexity = uwc*/length of article
        - uwc* = uwc - common words (show what we filtered)
        - Uwc = unique word count
    - Use complexity to determine language level requirements for resorts (how do we calculate that? —> Goethe-texts analysis)
    - Comparison to Wiener Sachtext-Formel:
        - Show formula
- Show code for uwc, explain **briefly**
    - Extract word count, articleID, body, kw_classification (tags/resorts) from expense.csv
    - Calculate uwc* from body
    - Calculate complexity from uwc*, word count
    - Relate complexity with articleID and resort
    - Aggregate by resort, calculate average
- Show code for wiener, explain **briefly**
    - Percentage of words with tone, three or more and six or more syllables is considered.  Other factor is average sentence length

# 4) Visualizations
- Graph 1 (wir/wiener)
    - May help in determining the accessibility of articles within a resort (by language level)
    - May show what we expected: medicine is more complex than sports
- Graph 2 (wir/wiener)
    - Some articles are very unique, but not very long
    - May imply journalistic work/quality
- Graph 3 (combined)
    - Best correlations
    - Where do we differ from wiener?
    - —> transition to why?/potential errors

# 5) Potential errors
- For goethe/language level: too small sample size for texts of different levels
- We do not take sentence length into account, which is quite important as a long sentence makes it more complex to read due to context
- Wiener: does not ignore duplicate words (Donaueschingen)
- Dataset had errors; we had to remove lines as they did not have associated resort tags

# 6) areas of improvement/extension
- Differentiate between sk/sk+
- Differentiate between access device (mobile may be less complex, more quick info)
